# Arduino library for Texas Instruments (TI) TMP-series I²C Digital Temperature Sensors #

This is an Arduino-compatible library for the Texas Instruments (TI) LM- and TMP-series I²C Digital Temperature Sensors based on the LM75. The sensors currently supported and tested are:

* [TMP102 Low-Power Digital Temperature Sensor With SMBus and Two-Wire Serial Interface in SOT563](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp102.pdf)

Future versions intend to support and test with the following temperature sensors:

* TMP112
* TMP75/TMP175
* TMP275
* TMP100/TMP101
