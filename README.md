# Arduino library for I²C Temperature Sensors derived from the LM75 #

This library intends to support a large range of I²C temperature sensors based on the industry-standard LM75 package and/or protocol. The sensors currently supported and tested are:

* [Texas Instruments – TMP102](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp102.pdf) – Low-Power Digital Temperature Sensor With SMBus and Two-Wire Serial Interface in SOT563

Future versions intend to support and test with the following temperature sensors:

* [Texas Instruments - LM75A](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm75a.pdf) – Digital Temperature Sensor and Thermal Watchdog With Two-Wire Interface
* [Texas Instruments – LM75B/LM75C](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm75b.pdf) – Digital Temperature Sensor and Thermal Watchdog With Two-Wire Interface
* [Texas Instruments – TMP112](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp112.pdf) – High-Accuracy, Low-Power, Digital Temperature Sensor With SMBus and Two-Wire Serial Interface in SOT563
* [Texas Instruments – TMP75/TMP175](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp175.pdf) – Temperature Sensor With I²C and SMBus Interface in Industry Standard LM75 Form Factor and Pinout

* [Microchip Technology – AT30TS750A](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/AT30TS750A) – 9- to 12-bit Selectable, ±0.5°C Accurate Digital Temperature Sensor with Nonvolatile Registers
* [STMicroelectronics – STLM75](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/22/c6/56/13/dd/59/4b/43/CD00153511.pdf/files/CD00153511.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00153511.pdf) – Digital temperature sensor and thermal watchdog

Many other temperature sensors are likely to be compatible or trivially supportable.
