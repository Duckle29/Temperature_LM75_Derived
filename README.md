# Arduino library for Texas Instruments (TI) LM/TMP-series I²C Digital Temperature Sensors #

This is an Arduino-compatible library for the Texas Instruments (TI) LM- and TMP-series I²C Digital Temperature Sensors based on the LM75. The sensors currently supported and tested are:

* [TMP102](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp102.pdf) – Low-Power Digital Temperature Sensor With SMBus and Two-Wire Serial Interface in SOT563

Future versions intend to support and test with the following temperature sensors:

* [LM75B/LM75C](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm75b.pdf) – Digital Temperature Sensor and Thermal Watchdog With Two-Wire Interface
* [TMP112](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp112.pdf) – High-Accuracy, Low-Power, Digital Temperature Sensor With SMBus and Two-Wire Serial Interface in SOT563
* [TMP75/TMP175](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp175.pdf) – Temperature Sensor With I²C and SMBus Interface in Industry Standard LM75 Form Factor and Pinout
* [TMP275](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp275.pdf) –  ±0.5°C Temperature Sensor With I²C and SMBus Interface in Industry Standard LM75 Form Factor and Pinout
* [TMP100/TMP101](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp100.pdf) – Temperature Sensor With I²C and SMBus Interface with Alert Function in SOT-23 Package

Several other temperature sensors are likely to be compatible or trivially supportable.
